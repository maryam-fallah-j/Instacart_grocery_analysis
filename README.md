# Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

Instacart's business team is particularly interested in understanding the diversity of customers within their database and how purchasing patterns differ across segments. They recognize that a one-size-fits-all marketing approach is ineffective and are exploring a more personalized strategy.

The objective of this analysis is to identify meaningful customer segments and purchasing trends that can support targeted marketing campaigns. By tailoring promotions and product recommendations to specific customer groups, Instacart aims to improve engagement and drive sales growth.

This project investigates customer behaviors to help define an effective segmentation and marketing framework.

## Key Business Questions

- Which days of the week and hours of the day experience the highest order volume?
- During which periods do customers generate the most revenue?
- Given the broad price spectrum of products, how can pricing categories be simplified to better support marketing decisions?
- Are certain product categories more frequently purchased than others?
- What does customer brand loyalty look like across the dataset?
- Do purchasing behaviors differ depending on customer loyalty levels?
- Are there regional differences in ordering patterns?
- Is there a relationship between age, household composition, and buying behavior?
- What meaningful customer segments can be formed based on demographic variables such as age, income, product preferences, and family status?
- How do shopping habits vary between different customer groups?
